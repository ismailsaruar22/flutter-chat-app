# chat_app

It's a pretty simple chat app.Actually it is my very first chat app that i have ever developed.So i tried to make it as simple as i can.I used firebase for backend.Right now only sign up, sign in , firebase authentication ,group chat are implemented.I have plan to add more features in future.
